# What I did today?

- Follow laboratori of Architettura degli elaboratori :heavy_check_mark:

- Crypt my USB- Key :heavy_check_mark:

  - I still have to figure out, how make it work with Windows Tho, for now it works only on Linux

  - `dd bs=4K if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX1`

  - *slap that usb,* It can conteins so much random data
  
  ![slap_car_meme](/slapcar.png)

  - `cryptsetup -h sha256 -c aes-xts-plain -s 256 luksFormat /dev/sdX1`

  - *lets encrypt the Usb*

  - `mkfs.vfat  -F  32  /dev/mapper/private`

  - Probably it doesnt hurt for compatible reasons to format it in FAT32 but I could be wrong



# What I have done on the job?

- Finish a 1000 line PHP script :heavy_check_mark:

  - Fixed some bugs :heavy_check_mark: 

  - Comment it :heavy_check_mark:

  - Commit it on Git :heavy_check_mark:

- Change a cartdrige of the company Printer

  - :warning: Wash your hands after you will do that and DO NOT inhale the "dust" that come from it

- Additional configuration on a SmartPhone of a Co-Worker

  **Working time** (**14:30** - **18:30** [5H])

  

# And after that? In The evening?

- Write this daily log :heavy_check_mark:

- Installed at first **f.lux** on **MX Linux** and after **RedShift** :heavy_check_mark:

  - `sudo apt install fluxgui`

  - `sudo apt remove fluxgui`

  - `sudo apt install redshift-gtk`

    - I had to install also **geoclue-2.0**, if not It wouldnt work :heavy_check_mark:

      - because It could get the position (longitude/latitude)

      - `sudo apt install geoclue-2.0`

- Find a good Markdown editor :heavy_check_mark:

  - Settled for [**MarkText**](https://marktext.github.io/website/)

    - Downloaded it and given the permission of execution

      -  `chmod +x marktext-0.13.65-x86_64.AppImage`

      - shame that I didn't find a repo for it, 'cause is a good app
